# Notifications

- Emails go through the `Mailer` port: Resend when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set,
  otherwise SMTP at `SMTP_URL`, from `MAIL_FROM`. Requests never wait for
  them.
- Render every email from `notifications/domain/english.ts` and `french.ts`,
  in the reader's locale. Account emails go through `SendAuthEmail`.
- Notices are events, not sentences: the context stores what happened as
  typed data (`NoticeEventSchema`: a post published, failed with its reason,
  or unconfirmed; a channel to reconnect now or soon), the web app writes it
  from its catalogues, and emails are rendered when they go out. Add members
  and fields to an event; never rename or remove one, since notices are
  stored with it.
- Other contexts tell people through `Notify`, with a key that names the
  event, such as `post-target:<id>:<round>`: a key seen before
  (`notifications.sent_notices`) notifies nobody. Keys hold ids and instants,
  never content. Notify runs in a TransactionRunner transaction that joins
  the caller's, so the key, the notices and the start of `DeliverNoticeV1`,
  which emails them after the commit, go together. Publishing calls it
  through `PublicationOutcomes`, the channels context through
  `ChannelNotices`.
- Who hears about an event is `recipientsOf`: for a channel, the members who
  can act on it (`audienceOf`: `channel:connect`); for a post, its author
  (`NoticeRequest.author`), whatever their role, and the members with
  `post:schedule` who chose `everyPost`, off by default; for a post without
  an author, or whose author left the workspace, every member with
  `post:schedule`; for billing, every member with `billing:manage`. Every
  notice reaches the app; `NotificationPreferences` say which are also
  emailed (failed and unconfirmed posts and channels to reconnect by
  default, not published posts; billing's always, as no preference covers
  them). A preferences change writes only what it names.
- `Notify.resolve(key)` says an event was dealt with: its notices are marked
  read for everyone and its pending emails skipped. Publishing resolves a
  round once a member confirms or reposts it.
- `DeliverNoticeV1` is persisted contract: its tag, its payload (`key`), its
  activities `send/<n>` and `abandon`, its clocks `retry/<n>`. It retries a
  transport that refuses for now over about five hours, and skips readers who
  left the workspace (or, for a channel, may no longer connect channels:
  `readerPermissionOf`) or turned the email off meanwhile.
- The inbox belongs to a user, and `authorizeInbox` decides who acts on it:
  the user, or an OAuth client not bound to a workspace, with
  `workspace:read` to read and `workspace:write` to change; staff
  impersonating the user only read.
