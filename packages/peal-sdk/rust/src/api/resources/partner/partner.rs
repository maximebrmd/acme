It tells the state at the time of the call; webhooks tell each change as it happens. A section is null where the credential may not read it, never zero. The partner's home workspace is not listed: it is no customer. Newest first, 50 a page unless `limit` (at most 100) says otherwise, in the order and with the cursor of the list of the partner's workspaces (pass `next` as `before`; anything else is refused, 400): page through every customer to find those that need attention, as nothing filters them. `account` comes with the first page only: whether the account's workspaces, which share one plan and one channel count, hold more channels than the plan allows, and so schedule and publish nothing (null on a server that does not bill). Each section needs the permission that reads it in a workspace: `channel:read`, `post:read`, `engagement:read`, and `mayApprove` says whether the key holds `post:approve`. Needs the scope workspaces:read. Takes a partner key (`Authorization: Bearer peal_partner_…`): any other credential answers 403.
