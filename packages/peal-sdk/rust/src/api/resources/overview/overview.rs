    /// Answers what needs attention in each workspace the user belongs to, 50 a page at most, by name then id: the posts going out in the next 7 days, those waiting for an approval (and whether the user may approve them), those that finished in the last 7 days with a channel that failed or that must be checked; the channels connected, to reconnect and turned off; the inbox's threads waiting for an answer; and whether the workspace is over its plan. Each section is given only where the user's role in that workspace may read it, with the permission its own page takes (`post:read`, `channel:read`, `engagement:read`), and is null otherwise, never zero; a workspace that refuses the user, as one that requires two-step verification while the account does not have it on, is listed with its name, `refused`, and no figure at all. Pass the page's `nextCursor` as `cursor` for the next one; a cursor no page gave is a bad request. API keys belong to a workspace, not to anyone, and get 403, as do OAuth tokens bound to one workspace; the command line's token, bound to none, reads every workspace with what its scopes allow there.

    /// Lists the posts with a time from `from` (included) to `to` (excluded), at most 31 days apart (InvalidTimeRange otherwise), across the workspaces where the user may read posts (`post:read`), or only those of them that `workspaceIds` names (comma-separated ids). Posts waiting for an approval, scheduled, publishing and finished are listed; drafts and cancelled posts are not. They come by time, then id, 50 a page unless `limit` (at most 100) says otherwise; pass the page's `nextCursor` as `cursor`, with the same query, for the next one.
