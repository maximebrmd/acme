    /// <summary>
    /// Answers, for each workspace the partner owns, what needs attention: its channels (`connected`, `toReconnect`: to reconnect, as `channel.reconnect_needed` told; `off`: turned off), its posts (`scheduledNext7Days`, `awaitingApproval`, `failedLast7Days`: finished in the last 7 days with a channel that failed, as `post.failed` told; `unconfirmedLast7Days`: one that may be live and must be checked) and its inbox (`unanswered`: threads with a comment waiting for an answer). It tells the state at the time of the call; webhooks tell each change as it happens. A section is null where the credential may not read it, never zero. The partner's home workspace is not listed: it is no customer. Newest first, 50 a page unless `limit` (at most 100) says otherwise, in the order and with the cursor of the list of the partner's workspaces (pass `next` as `before`; anything else is refused, 400): page through every customer to find those that need attention, as nothing filters them. `account` comes with the first page only: whether the account's workspaces, which share one plan and one channel count, hold more channels than the plan allows, and so schedule and publish nothing (null on a server that does not bill). Each section needs the permission that reads it in a workspace: `channel:read`, `post:read`, `engagement:read`, and `mayApprove` says whether the key holds `post:approve`. Needs the scope workspaces:read. Takes a partner key (`Authorization: Bearer peal_partner_…`): any other credential answers 403.

Send an `Idempotency-Key` header (any text of your choosing, at most 255 characters, such as a UUID) to make a request safe to send again: within 24 hours, the same key with the same body answers the workspace the first request made, as it now stands, and makes no other; the same key with another body is refused (`IdempotencyKeyReused`), and answers `WorkspaceNotFound` once that workspace was deleted. Keys are kept per partner, as digests. Needs the scope workspaces:write. Takes a partner key (`Authorization: Bearer peal_partner_…`): any other credential answers 403.

It cannot be undone. Answers 409 while a post of the workspace is being published (`WorkspaceBusy`): send it again a moment later. The deletion is recorded by id in the object store before it is done, so that a restored backup deletes the workspace again; when the store cannot be reached, nothing is deleted (503 `MediaStoreUnavailable`).
